🐍 Snake Game
A classic Snake Game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is simple — eat the food, grow your snake, and try not to collide with yourself!

🚀 Live Demo
You can run the game by simply opening the index.html file in any modern web browser.

🕹️ How to Play
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake:

↑ Up

↓ Down

← Left

→ Right

Eat the red square (food) to grow and increase your score.

Every 50 points, the level increases and the game speed gets faster.

Don't let the snake collide with itself — or the game will reset!

📦 Features

Increasing difficulty based on score.

Score and level tracking.

Snake wraps around the screen (no wall collisions).

Clean UI with simple game controls.
